Conditioning LLMs with Emotion in Neural Machine Translation,"['Charles Brazier', 'Jean-Luc Rouas']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Natural
Language Processing tasks, including Machine Translation (MT). In this work, we
propose a novel MT pipeline that integrates emotion information extracted from
a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model into LLMs to enhance translation
quality. We first fine-tune five existing LLMs on the Libri-trans dataset and
select the most performant model. Subsequently, we augment LLM prompts with
different dimensional emotions and train the selected LLM under these different
configurations. Our experiments reveal that integrating emotion information,
especially arousal, into LLM prompts leads to notable improvements in
translation quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03150v1,2024-08-06,2408.03150v1,Conditioning LLMs with Emotion in Neural Machine Translation,gpt-4,highly relevant,The paper is related to prompt engineering as it talks about augmenting LLM prompts with different dimensional emotions and training the model under these different configurations.,,
500xCompressor: Generalized Prompt Compression for Large Language Models,"['Zongqian Li', 'Yixuan Su', 'Nigel Collier']","Prompt compression is crucial for enhancing inference speed, reducing costs,
and improving user experience. However, current methods face challenges such as
low compression ratios and potential data leakage during evaluation. To address
these issues, we propose 500xCompressor, a method that compresses extensive
natural language contexts into a minimum of one single special token. The
500xCompressor introduces approximately 0.3% additional parameters and achieves
compression ratios ranging from 6x to 480x. It is designed to compress any
text, answer various types of questions, and could be utilized by the original
large language model (LLM) without requiring fine-tuning. Initially,
500xCompressor was pretrained on the Arxiv Corpus, followed by fine-tuning on
the ArxivQA dataset, and subsequently evaluated on strictly unseen and
classical question answering (QA) datasets. The results demonstrate that the
LLM retained 62.26-72.89% of its capabilities compared to using non-compressed
prompts. This study also shows that not all the compressed tokens are equally
utilized and that K V values have significant advantages over embeddings in
preserving information at high compression ratios. The highly compressive
nature of natural language prompts, even for fine-grained complex information,
suggests promising potential for future applications and further research into
developing a new LLM language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03094v1,2024-08-06,2408.03094v1,500xCompressor: Generalized Prompt Compression for Large Language Models,gpt-4,highly relevant,"The paper discusses prompt compression, a technique for refining prompting in large language models which is highly related to the concept of prefix prompt engineering.

LLMs as Probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teachers for DFA Learning,"['Lekai Chen', 'Ashutosh Trivedi', 'Alvaro Velasquez']","The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has inspired
investigations into their integration into automata learning. This paper
introduces the probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teacher (pMAT) formulation,
which leverages a probabilistic oracle that could give persistent errors
randomly during answering the membership queries for deterministic finite
automata (DFA) learning. Given the tendency of LLMs to produce hallucinatory
content, we have developed techniques to improve answer accuracy and ensure the
correctness of the learned automata. We propose the $\mathtt{Discrimination}$
prompt as well as the $\mathtt{Verification}$ prompt and explore their
advantages over common prompts. Additionally, we compare DFA learning
performance between the TTT algorithm and common active learning algorithms. To
address the exponential number of persistent errors, we implement a dynamic
query cache refinement algorithm that identifies and corrects conflicting
queries by combining the active and passive learning algorithms. The empirical
results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach, providing a
theoretical foundation for automata learning with LLMs in the loop.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02999v1,2024-08-06,2408.02999v1,LLMs as Probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teachers for DFA Learning,gpt-4,highly relevant,"The paper discusses the use of two different types of prompts, the Discrimination prompt, and the Verification prompt, in terms of improving accuracy in language models and ensuring correct automata learning, which is directly associated with prompt engineering.",https://ashay-sriv-images.s3.amazonaws.com/LLMs as Probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teachers for DFA Learning.png,"A

Accuracy and Consistency of LLMs in the Registered Dietitian Exam: The Impact of Prompt Engineering and Knowledge Retrieval,"['Iman Azimi', 'Mohan Qi', 'Li Wang', 'Amir M. Rahmani', 'Youlin Li']","Large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally transforming human-facing
applications in the health and well-being domains: boosting patient engagement,
accelerating clinical decision-making, and facilitating medical education.
Although state-of-the-art LLMs have shown superior performance in several
conversational applications, evaluations within nutrition and diet applications
are still insufficient. In this paper, we propose to employ the Registered
Dietitian (RD) exam to conduct a standard and comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, assessing
both accuracy and consistency in nutrition queries. Our evaluation includes
1050 RD exam questions encompassing several nutrition topics and proficiency
levels. In addition, for the first time, we examine the impact of Zero-Shot

and Retrieval Augmented Prompting (RAP) on both accuracy and consistency of the
responses. Our findings revealed that while these LLMs obtained acceptable
overall performance, their results varied considerably with different prompts
and question domains. GPT-4o with CoT-SC prompting outperformed the other
approaches, whereas Gemini 1.5 Pro with ZS recorded the highest consistency.
For GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, CoT improved the accuracy, and CoT-SC improved both

Training LLMs to Recognize Hedges in Spontaneous Narratives,"['Amie J. Paige', 'Adil Soubki', 'John Murzaku', 'Owen Rambow', 'Susan E. Brennan']","Hedges allow speakers to mark utterances as provisional, whether to signal
non-prototypicality or ""fuzziness"", to indicate a lack of commitment to an
utterance, to attribute responsibility for a statement to someone else, to
invite input from a partner, or to soften critical feedback in the service of
face-management needs. Here we focus on hedges in an experimentally
parameterized corpus of 63 Roadrunner cartoon narratives spontaneously produced
from memory by 21 speakers for co-present addressees, transcribed to text
(Galati and Brennan, 2010). We created a gold standard of hedges annotated by
human coders (the Roadrunner-Hedge corpus) and compared three LLM-based
approaches for hedge detection: fine-tuning BERT, and zero and few-shot
prompting with GPT-4o and LLaMA-3. The best-performing approach was a
fine-tuned BERT model, followed by few-shot GPT-4o. After an error analysis on
the top performing approaches, we used an LLM-in-the-Loop approach to improve
the gold standard coding, as well as to highlight cases in which hedges are
ambiguous in linguistically interesting ways that will guide future research.

Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally can be More Effective than Scaling Model Parameters,"['Charlie Snell', 'Jaehoon Lee', 'Kelvin Xu', 'Aviral Kumar']","Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation is
a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can
operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of
inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if
an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time
compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?
Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance
of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff
inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little
research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time
inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for
a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms
to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based
verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a
response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,
the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute
critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation
motivates applying a ""compute-optimal"" scaling strategy, which acts to most
effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this
compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute
scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a
FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model
attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to
outperform a 14x larger model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03314v1,2024-08-06,2408.03314v1,Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally can be More Effective than Scaling Model Parameters,gpt-4,somewhat relevant,"The paper focuses on the scalability of inference-time computation in large language models and how it can improve its performance based on prompts, which is a central discussion in prompt engineering.",https://ashay-sriv-images.s3.amazonaws.com/Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally can be More Effective than Scaling Model Parameters.png,"gure 23 ∣Revision model example 7.

Unveiling Factual Recall Behaviors of Large Language Models through Knowledge Neurons,"['Yifei Wang', 'Yuheng Chen', 'Wanting Wen', 'Yu Sheng', 'Linjing Li', 'Daniel Dajun Zeng']","In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) actively
recall or retrieve their internal repositories of factual knowledge when faced
with reasoning tasks. Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at
each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness
the critical factual associations under certain circumstances. Instead, they
tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning
questions. By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge
in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves
reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation.
Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a
powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks. Our findings
indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging
LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning. Furthermore, we explored how
contextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process
to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs.

KaPO: Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization for Controllable Knowledge Selection in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models,"['Ruizhe Zhang', 'Yongxin Xu', 'Yuzhen Xiao', 'Runchuan Zhu', 'Xinke Jiang', 'Xu Chu', 'Junfeng Zhao', 'Yasha Wang']","By integrating external knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become an effective strategy for mitigating the hallucination problems that
large language models (LLMs) encounter when dealing with knowledge-intensive
tasks. However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric
supporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge
conflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance
the knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused
on refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless,
due to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives,
models fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors in the
intricate and realistic retrieval scenarios. To this end, we propose a
Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization, dubbed KaPO, aimed at achieving
controllable knowledge selection in real retrieval scenarios. Concretely, we
explore and simulate error types across diverse context combinations and learn
how to avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods.
Simultaneously, by adjusting the balance between response length and the
proportion of preference data representing different behavior patterns, we

Static IR Drop Prediction with Attention U-Net and Saliency-Based Explainability,"['Lizi Zhang', 'Azadeh Davoodi']","There has been significant recent progress to reduce the computational effort

model with attention gates which is specifically tailored to achieve fast and
accurate image-based static IR drop prediction. Attention gates allow selective
emphasis on relevant parts of the input data without supervision which is
desired because of the often sparse nature of the IR drop map. We propose a

StructEval: Deepen and Broaden Large Language Model Assessment via Structured Evaluation,"['Boxi Cao', 'Mengjie Ren', 'Hongyu Lin', 'Xianpei Han', 'Feng Zhang', 'Junfeng Zhan', 'Le Sun']","Evaluation is the baton for the development of large language models. Current
evaluations typically employ a single-item assessment paradigm for each atomic
test objective, which struggles to discern whether a model genuinely possesses
the required capabilities or merely memorizes/guesses the answers to specific
questions. To this end, we propose a novel evaluation framework referred to as
StructEval. Starting from an atomic test objective, StructEval deepens and
broadens the evaluation by conducting a structured assessment across multiple
cognitive levels and critical concepts, and therefore offers a comprehensive,
robust and consistent evaluation for LLMs. Experiments on three widely-used
benchmarks demonstrate that StructEval serves as a reliable tool for resisting
the risk of data contamination and reducing the interference of potential
biases, thereby providing more reliable and consistent conclusions regarding
model capabilities. Our framework also sheds light on the design of future
principled and trustworthy LLM evaluation protocols.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03281v1,2024-08-06,2408.03281v1,StructEval: Deepen and Broaden Large Language Model Assessment via Structured Evaluation,gpt-4,highly irrelevant,"The paper is focused on evaluating model capabilities and bias, with no mention of prefix prompting or prompt engineering.",https://ashay-sriv-images.s3.amazonaws.com/StructEval_ Deepen and Broaden Large Language Model Assessment via Structured Evaluation.png,"Figure 5: The annotation guidelines for our human evaluation.

Compress and Compare: Interactively Evaluating Efficiency and Behavior Across ML Model Compression Experiments,"['Angie Boggust', 'Venkatesh Sivaraman', 'Yannick Assogba', 'Donghao Ren', 'Dominik Moritz', 'Fred Hohman']","To deploy machine learning models on-device, practitioners use compression
algorithms to shrink and speed up models while maintaining their high-quality
output. A critical aspect of compression in practice is model comparison,
including tracking many compression experiments, identifying subtle changes in
model behavior, and negotiating complex accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.
However, existing compression tools poorly support comparison, leading to
tedious and, sometimes, incomplete analyses spread across disjoint tools. To
support real-world comparative workflows, we develop an interactive visual
system called Compress and Compare. Within a single interface, Compress and
Compare surfaces promising compression strategies by visualizing provenance
relationships between compressed models and reveals compression-induced
behavior changes by comparing models' predictions, weights, and activations. We
demonstrate how Compress and Compare supports common compression analysis tasks
through two case studies, debugging failed compression on generative language
models and identifying compression artifacts in image classification models. We
further evaluate Compress and Compare in a user study with eight compression
experts, illustrating its potential to provide structure to compression
workflows, help practitioners build intuition about compression, and encourage
thorough analysis of compression's effect on model behavior. Through these
evaluations, we identify compression-specific challenges that future visual
analytics tools should consider and Compress and Compare visualizations that
may generalize to broader model comparison tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03274v1,2024-08-06,2408.03274v1,Compress and Compare: Interactively Evaluating Efficiency and Behavior Across ML Model Compression Experiments,gpt-4,highly irrelevant,The paper primarily discusses compression of machine learning models and does not mention anything about prompt engineering or hard prefix prompts.,https://ashay-sriv-images.s3.amazonaws.com/Compress and Compare_ Interactively Evaluating Efficiency and Behavior Across ML Model Compression E.png,"e pruning

Personalizing Federated Instrument Segmentation with Visual Trait Priors in Robotic Surgery,"['Jialang Xu', 'Jiacheng Wang', 'Lequan Yu', 'Danail Stoyanov', 'Yueming Jin', 'Evangelos B. Mazomenos']","Personalized federated learning (PFL) for surgical instrument segmentation
(SIS) is a promising approach. It enables multiple clinical sites to
collaboratively train a series of models in privacy, with each model tailored
to the individual distribution of each site. Existing PFL methods rarely
consider the personalization of multi-headed self-attention, and do not account
for appearance diversity and instrument shape similarity, both inherent in
surgical scenes. We thus propose PFedSIS, a novel PFL method with visual trait
priors for SIS, incorporating global-personalized disentanglement (GPD),
appearance-regulation personalized enhancement (APE), and shape-similarity
global enhancement (SGE), to boost SIS performance in each site. GPD represents
the first attempt at head-wise assignment for multi-headed self-attention
personalization. To preserve the unique appearance representation of each site
and gradually leverage the inter-site difference, APE introduces appearance
regulation and provides customized layer-wise aggregation solutions via
hypernetworks for each site's personalized parameters. The mutual shape
information of instruments is maintained and shared via SGE, which enhances the
cross-style shape consistency on the image level and computes the
shape-similarity contribution of each site on the prediction level for updating
the global parameters. PFedSIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with +1.51%

A Debiased Nearest Neighbors Framework for Multi-Label Text Classification,"['Zifeng Cheng', 'Zhiwei Jiang', 'Yafeng Yin', 'Zhaoling Chen', 'Cong Wang', 'Shiping Ge', 'Qiguo Huang', 'Qing Gu']","Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves assigning multiple non-exclusive labels to each document.
Previous studies primarily focus on capturing label correlations to assist
label prediction by introducing special labeling schemes, designing specific

($k$NN) framework has shown promise by retrieving labeled samples as references
to mine label co-occurrence information in the embedding space. However, two
critical biases, namely embedding alignment bias and confidence estimation
bias, are often overlooked, adversely affecting prediction performance. In this
paper, we introduce a DEbiased Nearest Neighbors (DENN) framework for MLTC,
specifically designed to mitigate these biases. To address embedding alignment
bias, we propose a debiased contrastive learning strategy, enhancing neighbor
consistency on label co-occurrence. For confidence estimation bias, we present
a debiased confidence estimation strategy, improving the adaptive combination
of predictions from $k$NN and inductive binary classifications. Extensive

Adversarial Safety-Critical Scenario Generation using Naturalistic Human Driving Priors,"['Kunkun Hao', 'Yonggang Luo', 'Wen Cui', 'Yuqiao Bai', 'Jucheng Yang', 'Songyang Yan', 'Yuxi Pan', 'Zijiang Yang']","Evaluating the decision-making system is indispensable in developing
autonomous vehicles, while realistic and challenging safety-critical test
scenarios play a crucial role. Obtaining these scenarios is non-trivial, thanks
to the long-tailed distribution, sparsity, and rarity in real-world data sets.
To tackle this problem, in this paper, we introduce a natural adversarial
scenario generation solution using naturalistic human driving priors and
reinforcement learning techniques. By doing this, we can obtain large-scale
test scenarios that are both diverse and realistic. Specifically, we build a
simulation environment that mimics natural traffic interaction scenarios.
Informed by this environment, we implement a two-stage procedure. The first
stage incorporates conventional rule-based models, e.g., IDM~(Intelligent
Driver Model) and MOBIL~(Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane changes)
model, to coarsely and discretely capture and calibrate key control parameters
from the real-world dataset. Next, we leverage GAIL~(Generative Adversarial
Imitation Learning) to represent driver behaviors continuously. The derived
GAIL can be further used to design a PPO~(Proximal Policy Optimization)-based
actor-critic network framework to fine-tune the reward function, and then
optimizes our natural adversarial scenario generation solution. Extensive
experiments have been conducted in the NGSIM dataset including the trajectory
of 3,000 vehicles. Essential traffic parameters were measured in comparison
with the baseline model, e.g., the collision rate, accelerations, steering, and
the number of lane changes. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model
can generate realistic safety-critical test scenarios covering both naturalness
and adversariality, which can be a cornerstone for the development of
autonomous vehicles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03200v1,2024-08-06,2408.03200v1,Adversarial Safety-Critical Scenario Generation using Naturalistic Human Driving Priors,gpt-4,highly irrelevant,This paper focuses on safety-critical scenario generation for autonomous vehicles using naturalistic human driving priors and reinforcement learning techniques.

Leveraging Parameter Efficient Training Methods for Low Resource Text Classification: A Case Study in Marathi,"['Pranita Deshmukh', 'Nikita Kulkarni', 'Sanhita Kulkarni', 'Kareena Manghani', 'Raviraj Joshi']","With the surge in digital content in low-resource languages, there is an
escalating demand for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques

to various monolingual and multilingual Marathi BERT models. These approaches
are evaluated on prominent text classification datasets like MahaSent,

Training on the Fly: On-device Self-supervised Learning aboard Nano-drones within 20 mW,"['Elia Cereda', 'Alessandro Giusti', 'Daniele Palossi']","Miniaturized cyber-physical systems (CPSes) powered by tiny machine learning
(TinyML), such as nano-drones, are becoming an increasingly attractive
technology. Their small form factor (i.e., ~10cm diameter) ensures vast
applicability, ranging from the exploration of narrow disaster scenarios to
safe human-robot interaction. Simple electronics make these CPSes inexpensive,
but strongly limit the computational, memory, and sensing resources available
on board. In real-world applications, these limitations are further exacerbated
by domain shift. This fundamental machine learning problem implies that model
perception performance drops when moving from the training domain to a
different deployment one. To cope with and mitigate this general problem, we
present a novel on-device fine-tuning approach that relies only on the limited
ultra-low power resources available aboard nano-drones. Then, to overcome the
lack of ground-truth training labels aboard our CPS, we also employ a
self-supervised method based on ego-motion consistency. Albeit our work builds
on top of a specific real-world vision-based human pose estimation task, it is
widely applicable for many embedded TinyML use cases. Our 512-image on-device
training procedure is fully deployed aboard an ultra-low power GWT GAP9
System-on-Chip and requires only 1MB of memory while consuming as low as 19mW
or running in just 510ms (at 38mW). Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our
on-device learning approach by field-testing our closed-loop CPS, showing a
reduction in horizontal position error of up to 26% vs. a non-fine-tuned

Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings makes visual models more aligned with humans: a Grad-CAM study,"['Rabih Chamas', 'Ismail Khalfaoui-Hassani', 'Timothee Masquelier']","Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacing (DCLS) is a recent advanced
convolution method that allows enlarging the receptive fields (RF) without
increasing the number of parameters, like the dilated convolution, yet without
imposing a regular grid. DCLS has been shown to outperform the standard and
dilated convolutions on several computer vision benchmarks. Here, we show that,
in addition, DCLS increases the models' interpretability, defined as the
alignment with human visual strategies. To quantify it, we use the Spearman
correlation between the models' GradCAM heatmaps and the ClickMe dataset
heatmaps, which reflect human visual attention. We took eight reference models
- ResNet50, ConvNeXt (T, S and B), CAFormer, ConvFormer, and FastViT (sa 24 and

improved the interpretability score in seven of them. Moreover, we observed
that Grad-CAM generated random heatmaps for two models in our study: CAFormer
and ConvFormer models, leading to low interpretability scores. We addressed
this issue by introducing Threshold-Grad-CAM, a modification built on top of
Grad-CAM that enhanced interpretability across nearly all models. The code and

Topic Modeling with Fine-tuning LLMs and Bag of Sentences,['Johannes Schneider'],"Large language models (LLM)'s are increasingly used for topic modeling
outperforming classical topic models such as LDA. Commonly, pre-trained LLM
encoders such as BERT are used out-of-the-box despite the fact that fine-tuning
is known to improve LLMs considerably. The challenge lies in obtaining a
suitable (labeled) dataset for fine-tuning. In this paper, we use the recent
idea to use bag of sentences as the elementary unit in computing topics. In
turn, we derive an approach FT-Topic to perform unsupervised fine-tuning
relying primarily on two steps for constructing a training dataset in an
automatic fashion. First, a heuristic method to identifies pairs of sentence
groups that are either assumed to be of the same or different topics. Second,
we remove sentence pairs that are likely labeled incorrectly. The dataset is
then used to fine-tune an encoder LLM, which can be leveraged by any topic
modeling approach using embeddings. However, in this work, we demonstrate its
effectiveness by deriving a novel state-of-the-art topic modeling method called
SenClu, which achieves fast inference through an expectation-maximization
algorithm and hard assignments of sentence groups to a single topic, while
giving users the possibility to encode prior knowledge on the topic-document
distribution.

Learning Provably Robust Policies in Uncertain Parametric Environments,"['Yannik Schnitzer', 'Alessandro Abate', 'David Parker']","We present a data-driven approach for learning MDP policies that are robust
across stochastic environments whose transition probabilities are defined by
parameters with an unknown distribution. We produce probably approximately
correct (PAC) guarantees for the performance of these learned policies in a
new, unseen environment over the unknown distribution. Our approach is based on
finite samples of the MDP environments, for each of which we build an
approximation of the model as an interval MDP, by exploring a set of generated
trajectories. We use the built approximations to synthesise a single policy
that performs well (meets given requirements) across the sampled environments,
and furthermore bound its risk (of not meeting the given requirements) when
deployed in an unseen environment. Our procedure offers a trade-off between the
guaranteed performance of the learned policy and the risk of not meeting the
guarantee in an unseen environment. Our approach exploits knowledge of the
environment's state space and graph structure, and we show how additional
knowledge of its parametric structure can be leveraged to optimize learning and
to obtain tighter guarantees from less samples. We evaluate our approach on a
diverse range of established benchmarks, demonstrating that we can generate
highly performing and robust policies, along with guarantees that tightly
quantify their performance and the associated risk.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03093v1,2024-08-06,2408.03093v1,Learning Provably Robust Policies in Uncertain Parametric Environments,gpt-4,highly irrelevant,"The paper focuses on learning MDP policies that are robust across stochastic environments, and does not discuss prompt engineering or hard prefix prompting techniques",https://ashay-sriv-images.s3.amazonaws.com/Learning Provably Robust Policies in Uncertain Parametric Environments.png,"1

Extend Model Merging from Fine-Tuned to Pre-Trained Large Language Models via Weight Disentanglement,"['Le Yu', 'Bowen Yu', 'Haiyang Yu', 'Fei Huang', 'Yongbin Li']","Merging Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to amalgamate multiple homologous
LLMs into one with all the capabilities. Ideally, any LLMs sharing the same
backbone should be mergeable, irrespective of whether they are Fine-Tuned (FT)

shifts. However, existing methods often manually assign the model importance,
rendering them feasible only for LLMs with similar parameter alterations, such
as multiple FT LLMs. The diverse parameter changed ranges between FT and PT
LLMs pose challenges for current solutions in empirically determining the
optimal combination. In this paper, we make a pioneering effort to broaden the
applicability of merging techniques from FT to PT LLMs. We initially examine

they struggle to deal with PT LLMs. Subsequently, we introduce an approach
based on WeIght DisENtanglement (WIDEN) to effectively extend the merging

components, and then performs adaptive fusion by considering their respective
contributions. In the experiments, we merge Qwen1.5-Chat (an FT LLM with
instruction-following skills) with Sailor (a PT LLM with multilingual
abilities) across 7B and 14B model scales. Results reveal that: (1) existing
solutions usually fail when merging Sailor, either losing both abilities or
only retaining instruction-following skills; (2) WIDEN successfully injects the
multilingual abilities of Sailor into Qwen1.5-Chat and make it proficient in
Southeast Asian languages, achieving enhancements in the fundamental
capabilities. In light of previous research, we also merge multiple 13B FT LLMs
and observe that WIDEN achieves a balanced amalgamation of instruction

Enhancing Complex Causality Extraction via Improved Subtask Interaction and Knowledge Fusion,"['Jinglong Gao', 'Chen Lu', 'Xiao Ding', 'Zhongyang Li', 'Ting Liu', 'Bing Qin']","Event Causality Extraction (ECE) aims at extracting causal event pairs from
texts. Despite ChatGPT's recent success, fine-tuning small models remains the
best approach for the ECE task. However, existing fine-tuning based ECE methods
cannot address all three key challenges in ECE simultaneously: 1) Complex
Causality Extraction, where multiple causal-effect pairs occur within a single
sentence; 2) Subtask~ Interaction, which involves modeling the mutual
dependence between the two subtasks of ECE, i.e., extracting events and
identifying the causal relationship between extracted events; and 3) Knowledge
Fusion, which requires effectively fusing the knowledge in two modalities,
i.e., the expressive pretrained language models and the structured knowledge
graphs. In this paper, we propose a unified ECE framework (UniCE to address all
three issues in ECE simultaneously. Specifically, we design a subtask
interaction mechanism to enable mutual interaction between the two ECE
subtasks. Besides, we design a knowledge fusion mechanism to fuse knowledge in
the two modalities. Furthermore, we employ separate decoders for each subtask

BodySLAM: A Generalized Monocular Visual SLAM Framework for Surgical Applications,"['G. Manni', 'C. Lauretti', 'F. Prata', 'R. Papalia', 'L. Zollo', 'P. Soda']","Endoscopic surgery relies on two-dimensional views, posing challenges for
surgeons in depth perception and instrument manipulation. While Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has emerged as a promising solution to address
these limitations, its implementation in endoscopic procedures presents
significant challenges due to hardware limitations, such as the use of a
monocular camera and the absence of odometry sensors. This study presents a
robust deep learning-based SLAM approach that combines state-of-the-art and
newly developed models. It consists of three main parts: the Monocular Pose
Estimation Module that introduces a novel unsupervised method based on the
CycleGAN architecture, the Monocular Depth Estimation Module that leverages the
novel Zoe architecture, and the 3D Reconstruction Module which uses information
from the previous models to create a coherent surgical map. The performance of
the procedure was rigorously evaluated using three publicly available datasets

competitive performance and the lowest inference time. The results showcase the

Probing structural constraints of negation in Pretrained Language Models,"['David Kletz', 'Marie Candito', 'Pascal Amsili']","Contradictory results about the encoding of the semantic impact of negation
in pretrained language models (PLMs). have been drawn recently (e.g. Kassner
and Sch{\""u}tze (2020); Gubelmann and Handschuh (2022)). In this paper we focus
rather on the way PLMs encode negation and its formal impact, through the
phenomenon of the Negative Polarity Item (NPI) licensing in English. More
precisely, we use probes to identify which contextual representations best
encode 1) the presence of negation in a sentence, and 2) the polarity of a
neighboring masked polarity item. We find that contextual representations of
tokens inside the negation scope do allow for (i) a better prediction of the
presence of not compared to those outside the scope and (ii) a better
prediction of the right polarity of a masked polarity item licensed by not,
although the magnitude of the difference varies from PLM to PLM. Importantly,
in both cases the trend holds even when controlling for distance to not. This
tends to indicate that the embeddings of these models do reflect the notion of
negation scope, and do encode the impact of negation on NPI licensing. Yet,
further control experiments reveal that the presence of other lexical items is
also better captured when using the contextual representation of a token within
the same syntactic clause than outside from it, suggesting that PLMs simply
capture the more general notion of syntactic clause.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03070v1,2024-08-06,2408.03070v1,Probing structural constraints of negation in Pretrained Language Models,gpt-4,highly irrelevant,"This paper discusses the linguistic concept of negation in the context of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs), focusing on how these models encode negation and its formal impact.

Analysis of Argument Structure Constructions in a Deep Recurrent Language Model,"['Pegah Ramezani', 'Achim Schilling', 'Patrick Krauss']","Understanding how language and linguistic constructions are processed in the
brain is a fundamental question in cognitive computational neuroscience. In
this study, we explore the representation and processing of Argument Structure
Constructions (ASCs) in a recurrent neural language model. We trained a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on a custom-made dataset consisting of 2000
sentences, generated using GPT-4, representing four distinct ASCs: transitive,
ditransitive, caused-motion, and resultative constructions.
  We analyzed the internal activations of the LSTM model's hidden layers using
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
(t-SNE) to visualize the sentence representations. The Generalized
Discrimination Value (GDV) was calculated to quantify the degree of clustering
within these representations. Our results show that sentence representations
form distinct clusters corresponding to the four ASCs across all hidden layers,
with the most pronounced clustering observed in the last hidden layer before
the output layer. This indicates that even a relatively simple,
brain-constrained recurrent neural network can effectively differentiate
between various construction types.
  These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the
emergence of word class and syntax rule representations in recurrent language
models trained on next word prediction tasks. In future work, we aim to
validate these results using larger language models and compare them with
neuroimaging data obtained during continuous speech perception. This study

Highly Efficient Self-Adaptive Reward Shaping for Reinforcement Learning,"['Haozhe Ma', 'Zhengding Luo', 'Thanh Vinh Vo', 'Kuankuan Sima', 'Tze-Yun Leong']","Reward shaping addresses the challenge of sparse rewards in reinforcement

exploitation, thus achieving a better balance between exploration and

Empathy Level Alignment via Reinforcement Learning for Empathetic Response Generation,"['Hui Ma', 'Bo Zhang', 'Bo Xu', 'Jian Wang', 'Hongfei Lin', 'Xiao Sun']","Empathetic response generation, aiming at understanding the user's situation
and feelings and respond empathically, is crucial in building human-like
dialogue systems. Previous methods mainly focus on using maximum likelihood
estimation as the optimization objective for training response generation
models, without taking into account the empathy level alignment between
generated responses and target responses. To this end, we propose an empathetic
response generation using reinforcement learning (EmpRL) framework. The
framework designs an effective empathy reward function and generates empathetic
responses by maximizing the expected reward through reinforcement learning.
Given the powerful text generation capability of pre-trained language models,
EmpRL utilizes the pre-trained T5 model as the generator and conducts further
training to initialize the policy. To align the empathy level between generated
responses and target responses in the context, an empathy reward function
containing three empathy communication mechanisms, i.e., emotional reaction,
interpretation, and exploration, is constructed using pre-designed and
pre-trained empathy identifiers. Finally, the proximal policy optimization

Both automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate that the proposed EmpRL
framework can improve the quality of generated responses, enhance the empathy

Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding with an Adaptive Delay-Based Heuristic,"['Thomy Phan', 'Benran Zhang', 'Shao-Hung Chan', 'Sven Koenig']","Anytime multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is a promising approach to scalable
path optimization in multi-agent systems. MAPF-LNS, based on Large Neighborhood
Search (LNS), is the current state-of-the-art approach where a fast initial
solution is iteratively optimized by destroying and repairing selected paths of
the solution. Current MAPF-LNS variants commonly use an adaptive selection
mechanism to choose among multiple destroy heuristics. However, to determine
promising destroy heuristics, MAPF-LNS requires a considerable amount of
exploration time. As common destroy heuristics are non-adaptive, any
performance bottleneck caused by these heuristics cannot be overcome via
adaptive heuristic selection alone, thus limiting the overall effectiveness of
MAPF-LNS in terms of solution cost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive
Delay-based Destroy-and-Repair Enhanced with Success-based Self-Learning
(ADDRESS) as a single-destroy-heuristic variant of MAPF-LNS. ADDRESS applies
restricted Thompson Sampling to the top-K set of the most delayed agents to
select a seed agent for adaptive LNS neighborhood generation. We evaluate
ADDRESS in multiple maps from the MAPF benchmark set and demonstrate cost
improvements by at least 50% in large-scale scenarios with up to a thousand
agents, compared with the original MAPF-LNS and other state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02960v1,2024-08-06,2408.02960v1,Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding with an Adaptive Delay-Based Heuristic,gpt-4,highly irrelevant,"The paper talks about heuristic path optimization in multi-agent systems, with no mention or relation to hard prefix prompting or prompt engineering.",,
