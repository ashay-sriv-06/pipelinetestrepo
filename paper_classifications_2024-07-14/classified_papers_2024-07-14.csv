CAD-Prompted Generative Models: A Pathway to Feasible and Novel Engineering Designs,"['Leah Chong', 'Jude Rayan', 'Steven Dow', 'Ioanna Lykourentzou', 'Faez Ahmed']","Text-to-image generative models have increasingly been used to assist
designers during concept generation in various creative domains, such as
graphic design, user interface design, and fashion design. However, their
applications in engineering design remain limited due to the models' challenges
in generating images of feasible designs concepts. To address this issue, this
paper introduces a method that improves the design feasibility by prompting the
generation with feasible CAD images. In this work, the usefulness of this
method is investigated through a case study with a bike design task using an
off-the-shelf text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion 2.1. A diverse set of bike
designs are produced in seven different generation settings with varying CAD
image prompting weights, and these designs are evaluated on their perceived
feasibility and novelty. Results demonstrate that the CAD image prompting
successfully helps text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion 2.1 create
visibly more feasible design images. While a general tradeoff is observed
between feasibility and novelty, when the prompting weight is kept low around
0.35, the design feasibility is significantly improved while its novelty
remains on par with those generated by text prompts alone. The insights from
this case study offer some guidelines for selecting the appropriate CAD image
prompting weight for different stages of the engineering design process. When
utilized effectively, our CAD image prompting method opens doors to a wider
range of applications of text-to-image models in engineering design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08675v1,2024-07-11,2407.08675v1,CAD-Prompted Generative Models: A Pathway to Feasible and Novel Engineering Designs,gpt-4,highly relevant,"This paper is relevant to prompt engineering because it explores the use of prompting to assist text-to-image generative models, focusing on the improvement of design feasibility through CAD image prompting.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=2692x1248 at 0x7FB34BA0CAF0>,"Page 3: FIGURE 2: Example evaluation questions for a bike design concept

Video Diffusion Alignment via Reward Gradients,"['Mihir Prabhudesai', 'Russell Mendonca', 'Zheyang Qin', 'Katerina Fragkiadaki', 'Deepak Pathak']","We have made significant progress towards building foundational video
diffusion models. As these models are trained using large-scale unsupervised
data, it has become crucial to adapt these models to specific downstream tasks.
Adapting these models via supervised fine-tuning requires collecting target
datasets of videos, which is challenging and tedious. In this work, we utilize
pre-trained reward models that are learned via preferences on top of powerful
vision discriminative models to adapt video diffusion models. These models
contain dense gradient information with respect to generated RGB pixels, which
is critical to efficient learning in complex search spaces, such as videos. We
show that backpropagating gradients from these reward models to a video
diffusion model can allow for compute and sample efficient alignment of the
video diffusion model. We show results across a variety of reward models and
video diffusion models, demonstrating that our approach can learn much more
efficiently in terms of reward queries and computation than prior gradient-free
approaches. Our code, model weights,and more visualization are available at

Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Reactive Planning with Large Language Models,"['Rohan Sinha', 'Amine Elhafsi', 'Christopher Agia', 'Matthew Foutter', 'Edward Schmerling', 'Marco Pavone']","Foundation models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), trained on
internet-scale data possess zero-shot generalization capabilities that make
them a promising technology towards detecting and mitigating
out-of-distribution failure modes of robotic systems. Fully realizing this
promise, however, poses two challenges: (i) mitigating the considerable
computational expense of these models such that they may be applied online, and
(ii) incorporating their judgement regarding potential anomalies into a safe
control framework. In this work, we present a two-stage reasoning framework:
First is a fast binary anomaly classifier that analyzes observations in an LLM
embedding space, which may then trigger a slower fallback selection stage that
utilizes the reasoning capabilities of generative LLMs. These stages correspond
to branch points in a model predictive control strategy that maintains the
joint feasibility of continuing along various fallback plans to account for the
slow reasoner's latency as soon as an anomaly is detected, thus ensuring
safety. We show that our fast anomaly classifier outperforms autoregressive
reasoning with state-of-the-art GPT models, even when instantiated with
relatively small language models. This enables our runtime monitor to improve
the trustworthiness of dynamic robotic systems, such as quadrotors or
autonomous vehicles, under resource and time constraints. Videos illustrating
our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments are available on

Transformer Circuit Faithfulness Metrics are not Robust,"['Joseph Miller', 'Bilal Chughtai', 'William Saunders']","Mechanistic interpretability work attempts to reverse engineer the learned
algorithms present inside neural networks. One focus of this work has been to
discover 'circuits' -- subgraphs of the full model that explain behaviour on
specific tasks. But how do we measure the performance of such circuits? Prior
work has attempted to measure circuit 'faithfulness' -- the degree to which the
circuit replicates the performance of the full model. In this work, we survey
many considerations for designing experiments that measure circuit faithfulness
by ablating portions of the model's computation. Concerningly, we find existing
methods are highly sensitive to seemingly insignificant changes in the ablation
methodology. We conclude that existing circuit faithfulness scores reflect both
the methodological choices of researchers as well as the actual components of
the circuit - the task a circuit is required to perform depends on the ablation
used to test it. The ultimate goal of mechanistic interpretability work is to
understand neural networks, so we emphasize the need for more clarity in the
precise claims being made about circuits. We open source a library at

Is Your Model Really A Good Math Reasoner? Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning with Checklist,"['Zihao Zhou', 'Shudong Liu', 'Maizhen Ning', 'Wei Liu', 'Jindong Wang', 'Derek F. Wong', 'Xiaowei Huang', 'Qiufeng Wang', 'Kaizhu Huang']","Exceptional mathematical reasoning ability is one of the key features that
demonstrate the power of large language models (LLMs). How to comprehensively
define and evaluate the mathematical abilities of LLMs, and even reflect the
user experience in real-world scenarios, has emerged as a critical issue.
Current benchmarks predominantly concentrate on problem-solving capabilities,
which presents a substantial risk of model overfitting and fails to accurately
represent genuine mathematical reasoning abilities. In this paper, we argue
that if a model really understands a problem, it should be robustly and readily
applied across a diverse array of tasks. Motivated by this, we introduce
MATHCHECK, a well-designed checklist for testing task generalization and
reasoning robustness, as well as an automatic tool to generate checklists
efficiently. MATHCHECK includes multiple mathematical reasoning tasks and
robustness test types to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of both
mathematical reasoning ability and behavior testing. Utilizing MATHCHECK, we
develop MATHCHECK-GSM and MATHCHECK-GEO to assess mathematical textual
reasoning and multi-modal reasoning capabilities, respectively, serving as
upgraded versions of benchmarks including GSM8k, GeoQA, UniGeo, and Geometry3K.
We adopt MATHCHECK-GSM and MATHCHECK-GEO to evaluate over 20 LLMs and 11 MLLMs,
assessing their comprehensive mathematical reasoning abilities. Our results
demonstrate that while frontier LLMs like GPT-4o continue to excel in various
abilities on the checklist, many other model families exhibit a significant
decline. Further experiments indicate that, compared to traditional math
benchmarks, MATHCHECK better reflects true mathematical abilities and
represents mathematical intelligence more linearly, thereby supporting our
design. On our MATHCHECK, we can easily conduct detailed behavior analysis to
deeply investigate models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08733v1,2024-07-11,2407.08733v1,Is Your Model Really A Good Math Reasoner?

these forthcoming mobile machines is crucial when navigating through the
bustling streets in urban spaces. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a
compositional simulation platform for Embodied AI research in urban spaces.

WhisperNetV2: SlowFast Siamese Network For Lip-Based Biometrics,"['Abdollah Zakeri', 'Hamid Hassanpour', 'Mohammad Hossein Khosravi', 'Amir Masoud Nourollah']","Lip-based biometric authentication (LBBA) has attracted many researchers
during the last decade. The lip is specifically interesting for biometric
researchers because it is a twin biometric with the potential to function both
as a physiological and a behavioral trait. Although much valuable research was
conducted on LBBA, none of them considered the different emotions of the client
during the video acquisition step of LBBA, which can potentially affect the
client's facial expressions and speech tempo. We proposed a novel network
structure called WhisperNetV2, which extends our previously proposed network
called WhisperNet. Our proposed network leverages a deep Siamese structure with
triplet loss having three identical SlowFast networks as embedding networks.
The SlowFast network is an excellent candidate for our task since the fast
pathway extracts motion-related features (behavioral lip movements) with a high
frame rate and low channel capacity. The slow pathway extracts visual features
(physiological lip appearance) with a low frame rate and high channel capacity.
Using an open-set protocol, we trained our network using the CREMA-D dataset

potential solution; yet these contaminants may originate from altered versions
of the test set, evading detection during decontamination. How different types
of contamination impact the performance of language models on downstream tasks
is not fully understood. We present a taxonomy that categorizes the various

to LLMs' tool-use capabilities. However, there are evident gaps between
existing tool-use evaluations and real-world scenarios. Current evaluations
often use AI-generated queries, single-step tasks, dummy tools, and text-only
interactions, failing to reveal the agents' real-world problem-solving
abilities effectively. To address this, we propose GTA, a benchmark for General
Tool Agents, featuring three main aspects: (i) Real user queries: human-written

this design provides a significant performance benefit, the current

output, or weight stationary architectures. This can limit the achievable
performance of DNN inference and reduce the utilization of compute units.

Cloud Atlas: Efficient Fault Localization for Cloud Systems using Language Models and Causal Insight,"['Zhiqiang Xie', 'Yujia Zheng', 'Lizi Ottens', 'Kun Zhang', 'Christos Kozyrakis', 'Jonathan Mace']","Runtime failure and performance degradation is commonplace in modern cloud
systems. For cloud providers, automatically determining the root cause of
incidents is paramount to ensuring high reliability and availability as prompt
fault localization can enable faster diagnosis and triage for timely
resolution. A compelling solution explored in recent work is causal reasoning
using causal graphs to capture relationships between varied cloud system
performance metrics. To be effective, however, systems developers must
correctly define the causal graph of their system, which is a time-consuming,
brittle, and challenging task that increases in difficulty for large and
dynamic systems and requires domain expertise. Alternatively, automated
data-driven approaches have limited efficacy for cloud systems due to the
inherent rarity of incidents. In this work, we present Atlas, a novel approach

large language models (LLMs) to generate causal graphs using system
documentation, telemetry, and deployment feedback. Atlas is complementary to
data-driven causal discovery techniques, and we further enhance Atlas with a
data-driven validation step. We evaluate Atlas across a range of fault

"Operationalizing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Recommendations for Practitioners, Researchers, and Policy Makers","['Alex Oesterling', 'Usha Bhalla', 'Suresh Venkatasubramanian', 'Himabindu Lakkaraju']","As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly employed in diverse
real-world applications, there has been significant interest in regulating
these tools. To this end, several regulatory frameworks have been introduced by
different countries worldwide. For example, the European Union recently passed
the AI Act, the White House issued an Executive Order on safe, secure, and
trustworthy AI, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
issued the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (AI BoR). Many of these
frameworks emphasize the need for auditing and improving the trustworthiness of
AI tools, underscoring the importance of safety, privacy, explainability,
fairness, and human fallback options. Although these regulatory frameworks
highlight the necessity of enforcement, practitioners often lack detailed
guidance on implementing them. Furthermore, the extensive research on
operationalizing each of these aspects is frequently buried in technical papers
that are difficult for practitioners to parse. In this write-up, we address
this shortcoming by providing an accessible overview of existing literature
related to operationalizing regulatory principles. We provide
easy-to-understand summaries of state-of-the-art literature and highlight
various gaps that exist between regulatory guidelines and existing AI research,
including the trade-offs that emerge during operationalization. We hope that

Uncertainty Estimation of Large Language Models in Medical Question Answering,"['Jiaxin Wu', 'Yizhou Yu', 'Hong-Yu Zhou']","Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for natural language generation in
healthcare, but risk hallucinating factually incorrect information. Deploying
LLMs for medical question answering necessitates reliable uncertainty
estimation (UE) methods to detect hallucinations. In this work, we benchmark
popular UE methods with different model sizes on medical question-answering
datasets. Our results show that current approaches generally perform poorly in
this domain, highlighting the challenge of UE for medical applications. We also
observe that larger models tend to yield better results, suggesting a
correlation between model size and the reliability of UE. To address these
challenges, we propose Two-phase Verification, a probability-free Uncertainty
Estimation approach. First, an LLM generates a step-by-step explanation
alongside its initial answer, followed by formulating verification questions to
check the factual claims in the explanation. The model then answers these
questions twice: first independently, and then referencing the explanation.
Inconsistencies between the two sets of answers measure the uncertainty in the
original response. We evaluate our approach on three biomedical
question-answering datasets using Llama 2 Chat models and compare it against
the benchmarked baseline methods. The results show that our Two-phase

SPOCKMIP: Segmentation of Vessels in MRAs with Enhanced Continuity using Maximum Intensity Projection as Loss,"['Chethan Radhakrishna', 'Karthikesh Varma Chintalapati', 'Sri Chandana Hudukula Ram Kumar', 'Raviteja Sutrave', 'Hendrik Mattern', 'Oliver Speck', 'Andreas Nürnberger', 'Soumick Chatterjee']","Identification of vessel structures of different sizes in biomedical images
is crucial in the diagnosis of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the
sparsity of good-quality annotations of such images makes the task of vessel
segmentation challenging. Deep learning offers an efficient way to segment
vessels of different sizes by learning their high-level feature representations
and the spatial continuity of such features across dimensions. Semi-supervised
patch-based approaches have been effective in identifying small vessels of one
to two voxels in diameter. This study focuses on improving the segmentation
quality by considering the spatial correlation of the features using the
Maximum Intensity Projection~(MIP) as an additional loss criterion. Two methods
are proposed with the incorporation of MIPs of label segmentation on the
single~(z-axis) and multiple perceivable axes of the 3D volume. The proposed
MIP-based methods produce segmentations with improved vessel continuity, which
is evident in visual examinations of ROIs. Patch-based training is improved by
introducing an additional loss term, MIP loss, to penalise the predicted
discontinuity of vessels. A training set of 14 volumes is selected from the
StudyForrest dataset comprising of 18 7-Tesla 3D Time-of-Flight~(ToF) Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (MRA) images. The generalisation performance of the
method is evaluated using the other unseen volumes in the dataset. It is
observed that the proposed method with multi-axes MIP loss produces better
quality segmentations with a median Dice of $80.245 \pm 0.129$. Also, the
method with single-axis MIP loss produces segmentations with a median Dice of
$79.749 \pm 0.109$. Furthermore, a visual comparison of the ROIs in the
predicted segmentation reveals a significant improvement in the continuity of
the vessels when MIP loss is incorporated into training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08655v1,2024-07-11,2407.08655v1,SPOCKMIP: Segmentation of Vessels in MRAs with Enhanced Continuity using Maximum Intensity Projection as Loss,gpt-4,highly irrelevant,The paper focuses on biomedical image segmentation and does not mention or involve any techniques related to hard prefix prompting or prompt engineering.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=1430x1126 at 0x7FB34C7046A0>,"Page 8: Figure 6: Visual comparison of ROIs of MIPs of segmentations resulting from training all the models with MIP loss along the z-axis and MIP loss along multiple

Confidence-based Estimators for Predictive Performance in Model Monitoring,"['Juhani Kivimäki', 'Jakub Białek', 'Jukka K. Nurminen', 'Wojtek Kuberski']","After a machine learning model has been deployed into production, its
predictive performance needs to be monitored. Ideally, such monitoring can be
carried out by comparing the model's predictions against ground truth labels.
For this to be possible, the ground truth labels must be available relatively
soon after inference. However, there are many use cases where ground truth
labels are available only after a significant delay, or in the worst case, not
at all. In such cases, directly monitoring the model's predictive performance
is impossible.
  Recently, novel methods for estimating the predictive performance of a model
when ground truth is unavailable have been developed. Many of these methods
leverage model confidence or other uncertainty estimates and are experimentally
compared against a naive baseline method, namely Average Confidence (AC), which
estimates model accuracy as the average of confidence scores for a given set of
predictions. However, until now the theoretical properties of the AC method
have not been properly explored. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by
reviewing the AC method and show that under certain general assumptions, it is
an unbiased and consistent estimator of model accuracy with many desirable
properties. We also compare this baseline estimator against some more complex
estimators empirically and show that in many cases the AC method is able to
beat the others, although the comparative quality of the different estimators
is heavily case-dependent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08649v1,2024-07-11,2407.08649v1,Confidence-based Estimators for Predictive Performance in Model Monitoring,gpt-4,highly irrelevant,This paper is about monitoring the predictive performance of deployed machine learning models and does not discuss prompting techniques or prompt engineering.,<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=2079x910 at 0x7FB34B9950F0>,"Page 8: Confidence-based Estimators for Predictive Performance in Model Monitoring

FlashAttention-3: Fast and Accurate Attention with Asynchrony and Low-precision,"['Jay Shah', 'Ganesh Bikshandi', 'Ying Zhang', 'Vijay Thakkar', 'Pradeep Ramani', 'Tri Dao']","Attention, as a core layer of the ubiquitous Transformer architecture, is the
bottleneck for large language models and long-context applications.
FlashAttention elaborated an approach to speed up attention on GPUs through
minimizing memory reads/writes. However, it has yet to take advantage of new
capabilities present in recent hardware, with FlashAttention-2 achieving only
35% utilization on the H100 GPU. We develop three main techniques to speed up
attention on Hopper GPUs: exploiting asynchrony of the Tensor Cores and TMA to
(1) overlap overall computation and data movement via warp-specialization and
(2) interleave block-wise matmul and softmax operations, and (3) block
quantization and incoherent processing that leverages hardware support for FP8
low-precision. We demonstrate that our method, FlashAttention-3, achieves
speedup on H100 GPUs by 1.5-2.0$\times$ with FP16 reaching up to 740 TFLOPs/s
(75% utilization), and with FP8 reaching close to 1.2 PFLOPs/s. We validate

HACMan++: Spatially-Grounded Motion Primitives for Manipulation,"['Bowen Jiang', 'Yilin Wu', 'Wenxuan Zhou', 'Chris Paxton', 'David Held']","Although end-to-end robot learning has shown some success for robot
manipulation, the learned policies are often not sufficiently robust to
variations in object pose or geometry. To improve the policy generalization, we
introduce spatially-grounded parameterized motion primitives in our method
HACMan++. Specifically, we propose an action representation consisting of three
components: what primitive type (such as grasp or push) to execute, where the
primitive will be grounded (e.g. where the gripper will make contact with the
world), and how the primitive motion is executed, such as parameters specifying
the push direction or grasp orientation. These three components define a novel
discrete-continuous action space for reinforcement learning. Our framework
enables robot agents to learn to chain diverse motion primitives together and
select appropriate primitive parameters to complete long-horizon manipulation
tasks. By grounding the primitives on a spatial location in the environment,
our method is able to effectively generalize across object shape and pose
variations. Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in complex scenarios demanding both high-level sequential
reasoning and object generalization. With zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, our
policy succeeds in challenging real-world manipulation tasks, with
generalization to unseen objects. Videos can be found on the project website:

The Synergy between Data and Multi-Modal Large Language Models: A Survey from Co-Development Perspective,"['Zhen Qin', 'Daoyuan Chen', 'Wenhao Zhang', 'Liuyi Yao', 'Yilun Huang', 'Bolin Ding', 'Yaliang Li', 'Shuiguang Deng']","The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has been witnessed in
recent years. Based on the powerful LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) extend the
modality from text to a broader spectrum of domains, attracting widespread
attention due to the broader range of application scenarios. As LLMs and MLLMs
rely on vast amounts of model parameters and data to achieve emergent
capabilities, the importance of data is receiving increasingly widespread
attention and recognition. Tracing and analyzing recent data-oriented works for
MLLMs, we find that the development of models and data is not two separate
paths but rather interconnected. On the one hand, vaster and higher-quality
data contribute to better performance of MLLMs, on the other hand, MLLMs can
facilitate the development of data. The co-development of multi-modal data and
MLLMs requires a clear view of 1) at which development stage of MLLMs can
specific data-centric approaches be employed to enhance which capabilities, and
2) by utilizing which capabilities and acting as which roles can models
contribute to multi-modal data. To promote the data-model co-development for
MLLM community, we systematically review existing works related to MLLMs from
the data-model co-development perspective. A regularly maintained project

On the Universal Truthfulness Hyperplane Inside LLMs,"['Junteng Liu', 'Shiqi Chen', 'Yu Cheng', 'Junxian He']","While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities
across various fields, hallucination remains a significant challenge. Recent
studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal
representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs' adherence to facts.
However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data,
leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect
fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the
specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal
truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and
incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number
of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the
truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine
its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results
indicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly
enhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples
plays a less critical role. This finding supports the optimistic hypothesis
that a universal truthfulness hyperplane may indeed exist within the model,
offering promising directions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08582v1,2024-07-11,2407.08582v1,On the Universal Truthfulness Hyperplane Inside LLMs,gpt-4,highly irrelevant,"The paper is focused on the subject of hallucination, internal representations, and factual correctness of large language models, and does not discuss the topic of prompt engineering or hard prefix prompting.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGBA size=380x22 at 0x7FB34BA0F910>,"Page 1: hers

Multi-Group Proportional Representation,"['Alex Oesterling', 'Claudio Mayrink Verdun', 'Carol Xuan Long', 'Alex Glynn', 'Lucas Monteiro Paes', 'Sajani Vithana', 'Martina Cardone', 'Flavio P. Calmon']","Image search and retrieval tasks can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, erase
cultural identities, and amplify social disparities. Current approaches to
mitigate these representational harms balance the number of retrieved items
across population groups defined by a small number of (often binary)
attributes. However, most existing methods overlook intersectional groups
determined by combinations of group attributes, such as gender, race, and
ethnicity. We introduce Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR), a novel
metric that measures representation across intersectional groups. We develop
practical methods for estimating MPR, provide theoretical guarantees, and
propose optimization algorithms to ensure MPR in retrieval. We demonstrate that
existing methods optimizing for equal and proportional representation metrics
may fail to promote MPR. Crucially, our work shows that optimizing MPR yields
more proportional representation across multiple intersectional groups
