    <p>Prompt compression is crucial for enhancing inference speed, reducing costs,
and improving user experience. However, current methods face challenges such as
low compression ratios and potential data leakage during evaluation. To address
these issues, we propose 500xCompressor, a method that compresses extensive
natural language contexts into a minimum of one single special token. The
500xCompressor introduces approximately 0.3% additional parameters and achieves
compression ratios ranging from 6x to 480x. It is designed to compress any
text, answer various types of questions, and could be utilized by the original
large language model (LLM) without requiring fine-tuning. Initially,
500xCompressor was pretrained on the Arxiv Corpus, followed by fine-tuning on
the ArxivQA dataset, and subsequently evaluated on strictly unseen and
classical question answering (QA) datasets. The results demonstrate that the
LLM retained 62.26-72.89% of its capabilities compared to using non-compressed
prompts. This study also shows that not all the compressed tokens are equally
utilized and that K V values have significant advantages over embeddings in
preserving information at high compression ratios. The highly compressive
nature of natural language prompts, even for fine-grained complex information,
suggests promising potential for future applications and further research into
developing a new LLM language.</p>

    <p>The paper discusses prompt compression, a technique for refining prompting in large language models which is highly related to the concept of prefix prompt engineering. The paper explores ways to compress extensive natural language contexts into a single token, a concept closely related to hard prefix prompting.</p>
