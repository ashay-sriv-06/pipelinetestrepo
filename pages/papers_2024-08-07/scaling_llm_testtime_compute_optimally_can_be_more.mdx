    <p>Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation is
a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can
operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of
inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if
an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time
compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?
Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance
of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff
inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little
research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time
inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for
a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms
to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based
verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a
response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,
the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute
critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation
motivates applying a "compute-optimal" scaling strategy, which acts to most
effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this
compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute
scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a
FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model
attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to
outperform a 14x larger model.</p>

    <p>This paper focuses on the scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs and how it influences the performance on challenging prompts. It explores strategies that modify the model's response based on the prompt at test time, which is relevant to the topic of prompt engineering.</p>
