    <p>Recent advancements in long-context modeling have enhanced language models
(LMs) for complex tasks across multiple NLP applications. Despite this
progress, we find that these models struggle with multi-hop reasoning and
exhibit decreased performance in the presence of noisy contexts. In this paper,
we introduce Reasoning with Attributions, a novel approach that prompts LMs to
supply attributions for each assertion during their reasoning. We validate our
approach through experiments on three multi-hop datasets, employing both
proprietary and open-source models, and demonstrate its efficacy and
resilience. Furthermore, we explore methods to augment reasoning capabilities
via fine-tuning and offer an attribution-annotated dataset and a specialized
training strategy. Our fine-tuned model achieves competitive performance on
multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, closely paralleling proprietary LMs such as
ChatGPT and Claude-instant.</p>

    <p>The paper introduces a new approach that uses prompts to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models which is related to prompt engineering, but also focuses quite a bit on the fine-tuning aspect of training models.</p>
