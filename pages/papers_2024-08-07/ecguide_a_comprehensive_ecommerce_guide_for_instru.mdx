    <p>Large language models (LLMs) have attracted considerable attention in various
fields for their cost-effective solutions to diverse challenges, especially
with advancements in instruction tuning and quantization. E-commerce, with its
complex tasks and extensive product-user interactions, presents a promising
application area for LLMs. However, the domain-specific concepts and knowledge
inherent in e-commerce pose significant challenges for adapting general LLMs.
To address this issue, we developed EC-Guide
\href{https://github.com/fzp0424/EC-Guide-KDDUP-2024}, a comprehensive
e-commerce guide for instruction tuning and quantization of LLMs. We also
heuristically integrated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) during inference to enhance
arithmetic performance. Our approach achieved the 2nd place in Track 2 and 5th
place in Track 5 at the Amazon KDD Cup'24
\href{https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/amazon-kdd-cup-2024-multi-task-online-shopping-challenge-for-llms}.
Additionally, our solution is model-agnostic, enabling effective scalability
across larger systems.</p>
