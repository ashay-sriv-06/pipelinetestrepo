    <p>Imperfect information games, such as Bridge and Skat, present challenges due
to state-space explosion and hidden information, posing formidable obstacles
for search algorithms. Determinization-based algorithms offer a resolution by
sampling hidden information and solving the game in a perfect information
setting, facilitating rapid and effective action estimation. However,
transitioning to perfect information introduces challenges, notably one called
strategy fusion.This research introduces `Extended Perfect Information Monte
Carlo' (EPIMC), an online algorithm inspired by the state-of-the-art
determinization-based approach Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC). EPIMC
enhances the capabilities of PIMC by postponing the perfect information
resolution, reducing alleviating issues related to strategy fusion. However,
the decision to postpone the leaf evaluator introduces novel considerations,
such as the interplay between prior levels of reasoning and the newly deferred
resolution. In our empirical analysis, we investigate the performance of EPIMC
across a range of games, with a particular focus on those characterized by
varying degrees of strategy fusion. Our results demonstrate notable performance
enhancements, particularly in games where strategy fusion significantly impacts
gameplay. Furthermore, our research contributes to the theoretical foundation
of determinization-based algorithms addressing challenges associated with
strategy fusion.%, thereby enhancing our understanding of these algorithms
within the context of imperfect information game scenarios.</p>
