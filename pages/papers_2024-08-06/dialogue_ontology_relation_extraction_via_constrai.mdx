    <p>State-of-the-art task-oriented dialogue systems typically rely on
task-specific ontologies for fulfilling user queries. The majority of
task-oriented dialogue data, such as customer service recordings, comes without
ontology and annotation. Such ontologies are normally built manually, limiting
the application of specialised systems. Dialogue ontology construction is an
approach for automating that process and typically consists of two steps: term
extraction and relation extraction. In this work, we focus on relation
extraction in a transfer learning set-up. To improve the generalisation, we
propose an extension to the decoding mechanism of large language models. We
adapt Chain-of-Thought (CoT) decoding, recently developed for reasoning
problems, to generative relation extraction. Here, we generate multiple
branches in the decoding space and select the relations based on a confidence
threshold. By constraining the decoding to ontology terms and relations, we aim
to decrease the risk of hallucination. We conduct extensive experimentation on
two widely used datasets and find improvements in performance on target
ontology for source fine-tuned and one-shot prompted large language models.</p>

    <p>The study discusses the extension of the decoding mechanism of large language models and adaptation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) decoding for generative relation extraction, but it doesn't make direct reference to hard prefix prompting or prompt engineering.</p>
